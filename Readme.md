# Speech Emotion Analyzer

## Overview
The Speech Emotion Analyzer is a machine learning project aimed at identifying and classifying emotions from speech data. This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) to achieve high accuracy in emotion detection. The dataset comprises four emotion categories: Angry, Happy, Sad, and Neutral.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains four folders, each representing a different emotion:
- `angry`
- `happy`
- `sad`
- `neutral`

Each folder contains audio files labeled with the corresponding emotion.
